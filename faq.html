Fabrics may stretch from the very first wear.</p> 
                    <p>If we are notified shortly after you receive the garment that you’d like to exchange the same garment for a different size then we will happily exchange it for you.

                    <p>We do our best to ensure that every dress arrives to you wrinkle-free. After being steamed, all dresses are wrapped in tissue paper and placed in a waterproof satchel for protection. Certain fabrics are more prone to wrinkles, and if you receive a dress with slight creases, please try steaming the garment on low heat. Alternatively, you can hang the dress in a steamy bathroom and the steam will decrease any wrinkles. When steaming in a bathroom, please be sure to hang the dress where it won’t accidentally get splashed by the shower. Note: please do not iron the dress as this may cause permanent damage.</p>

                    <p>When a garment is a few seasons old and has some general wear and tear it will be put on sale. Sale items are not ‘for sale’ in the sense that you will own it out right, but rather it simply means the price to hire is reduced (on sale) from it’s original hire price. In case an item has very strong wear and tear we will mention this in the product description, however general wear and tear is to be expected when a garments hire fee is reduced (‘on sale’). If you are unsure about the condition of the specific item/ size you are enquiring for, please do not hesitate to contact us to ask.

                    <p>All our items are returned directly to our cleaners after hire. Every item, even those only tried on or worn once, gets cleaned and goes through our meticulous quality control and repairs process upon return. We are proud of our high cleaning and garment preservation standards at TheOnlyDress. Please do not attempt to clean the garment yourself under any circumstances. Depending on the condition in which a garment is returned to us, the cleaning costs us up to $45 per item. But we only charge you a flat rate of $20 AUD. Our hire prices stated on website do not include the cost of hand cleaning and any repairs (if necessary) to the garment after use. The cleaning fee is added to each garment you hire upon checkout. </p>
