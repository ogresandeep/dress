            <p>By accessing and using the TheOnlyDress website at www.theonlydress.com, you are accepting and consenting to the practices in these terms of use. “TheOnlyDress” (“we”, “our”, “us”) means its successors and assigns or any person acting on behalf of and with the authority of TheOnlyDress Pty Ltd, ACN 618122473. “Rental Period” means the weekend hire or agreed to period that the customer booked the dress for - starting from the day the dress is delivered to the customer’s delivery address/ or when the garment has been picked up. The dress must be returned on Monday before 12pm (12-noon) or if not for weekend hire, on the next business day after the event. Weekend hires will generally receive the hired garment on Thursday or Friday and these are to be returned at the post office the following Monday by 12pm (12-noon). “Rental Price” (“price”) means the cost to hire the Dress as agreed between TheOnlyDress and the customer. “Rental Return Due Date” means the date the Dress is expected to be back at TheOnlyDress’s address. Any instructions received by TheOnlyDress from the Customer for the hire of the Dress and/or the Customer’s acceptance of the Dress supplied for hire by TheOnlyDress shall constitute acceptance of the terms and conditions contained herein. The FAQ - frequently asked questions on our website form part of our terms and conditions and you agree to have read and accepted them as binding when placing an order.</p>
            <h4>Price and Payment</h4>
            <p>The Price shall be TheOnlyDress’ current price, at the date of delivery of the Dress, according to TheOnlyDress’ current Price list as detailed on TheOnlyDress’ website. TheOnlyDress reserves the right to change the Price in the event of a variation to the Customer’s requirements.</p>
            <h4>Cleaning Fee</h4>
            <p>Hire prices stated on website do not include the cleaning fee. The customer is charged $20AUD in addition to hire price (part of the shipping method when checking out). We are responsible for the cleaning of the item. Customer shall not attempt to clean the garment themself under any circumstances.  If the dress is heavily stained, especially with fake tan, the customer authorizes TheOnlyDress to charge an extra cleaning fee of $30AUD. In the event that fake tan stains a garment or perfume damages the fabric and prevents it from being rehired (meaning the tan is not removable), TheOnlyDress reserves the right to charge the Customer 150% of recommended retail value stated in the item description.</p>
            <p>TheOnlyDress requires a $50 AUD bond, which is fully refundable if the garment is returned in the same condition as it was delivered (excludes cleaning). Customer authorises TheOnlyDress to deduct repair or extra cleaning costs from this amount if any damages incurred.</p>
            <h4>Sizing</h4>
            <p>TheOnlyDress offers garments in different sizes, which is a recommendation only. Please ask us prior to making a booking about the fit when you are unsure of the fit. We strongly encourage all customers to try on the dress at a boutique prior to making a booking with us. Please note that Camilla items often fit differently even if it is the same style in the same size! We offer the exchange of sizes or items if the necessary time and availability is given for such an exchange to occur. The customer covers the actual postal fees for the replacement postage. This is not a flat rate.</p>
            <h4>Order Cancellations</h4>
            <p>TheOnlyDress may cancel your order due to an unforeseen event, such that the item you ordered suddenly became out of stock and/or is no longer available for hire. If an item in your order does become unavailable, you will be contacted about the cancellation via email. If your order contains additional items, these items will still be shipped to you and the unavailable item will be removed from your order. You will not be entitled to claim any additional amounts or seek compensation for any loss, expense or damage (either direct or consequential) for any loss of time or inconvenience, which may result from such a cancellation. You will receive a full refund in cases where we cancel your order. If an order was placed without checking availability or if you have exceeded the given time window that we kept the item on hold for you, a cancellation fee of $50 will be charged. You will be refunded the balance of the order to the bankcard in which you paid.</p>
            <p>We will issue a store credit if the customer cancels an order up to 7 business days prior to the beginning of their rental period. To cancel an order, we require the customer to contact our Customer Service. Upon cancellation of your order, we will authorize a refund issued as store credit to be put towards another dress hire at another time. The shipping and cleaning fee will be kept as part of the store credit. If you contact us after we have dispatched the garment, your rental period has started and we will not issue a cancellation of your order. Upon your cancellation request, if you fail to provide us with the requested and required personal documents we reserve the right not to issue you with a refund in the form of a store credit.</p>
            <h4>Rental Period and Late Fees</h4>
            <p>The rental period shall commence from when the Customer (or a third party nominated by the Customer) signs the Courier’s delivery receipt and shall continue until the Dress is lodged at the post office for its return to us. The item will arrive either one day before the requested event date or on the day, depending on when the customer places the order.</p>
            <p>In cases where the dress has not been returned to TheOnlyDress by the Rental Return Due Date then TheOnlyDress shall be entitled to charge additional hire fees until the Dress is returned to TheOnlyDress and the Customer expressly authorizes TheOnlyDress to deduct such additional hire fees from the Customer’s credit card which was provided at the time of placement of the Customer’s order. Such additional charges shall be charged a fixed fee of $80 for each day overdue. Weekend hire returns have to be lodged at an Australian Post Office on Monday before 12pm. Otherwise the hired garment is to be returned on the day after event. If the Customer has not returned the rental item(s) within 15 days after the return date, TheOnlyDress will consider the rental item(s) as non-returned and will charge the Customer’s credit card 150% of the recommended retail value stated on the item’s description page on our website minus any late fees that the Customer has already paid. The rental fee will not be subtracted. In the rare case the customer posted the return wrongfully (i.e. wrong street box or address, forgotten signature or similar) thereby causing delay in the garments return to us, the customer will be charged a late fee. Garment must be returned from the same state that it had been delivered to (unless otherwise agreed).</p>
            <h4>Shipping Policy</h4>
            <p>TheOnlyDress’s standard delivery method is Express Signature postage operated by Australia Post.  The estimated standard delivery time for express post is 1-2 business days - depending on your location and the time you submitted your order. Upon receiving a customers order, we post the dress out to you so that it will arrive one day prior to your event or to arrive on the day of event. This is usually a Thursday or Friday for weekend events. It is upon our discretion to post the garment earlier. Please allow 3-4 days for arrival if you live in a rural location and if in Western Australia. It is the customer’s responsibility to calculate how long the dress may take to arrive to your delivery address, and ensure that you place your order with sufficient time to ensure that the garment will arrive in time for your event. Customer bears the risk of delivery. The earliest we can possibly ship out a garment is on the next business day for orders placed by 6pm the previous day. Pick up must be liaised prior placing an order.</p>
            <h4>Damages</h4>
            <p>The Customer must inspect the Dress upon receipt of delivery and shall within four (4) hours of receipt notify TheOnlyDress (by phone or email) of any alleged defect, shortage in quantity, damage or failure to comply with what was ordered. TheOnlyDress retains ownership of the dress property. All risk associated with the dress passes to the Customer at the time of us sending the garment to the customer at the post office. The Customer accepts full responsibility for the safekeeping of the dress. Customers will not attempt to clean, repair, or alter the garment(s) at any time without consent from TheOnlyDress. If the dress gets damaged or has been returned with wear and tear, the client will pay the applicable repair/alteration fees – following a quote provided by TheOnlyDress. The customer is not to arrange repair. In addition to the repair fees, the customer shall pay any loss of business and possible loss in value of item due to the damage incurred to the dress. If the item is damaged in a visible area affecting the look and quality of the dress and/or the damage cannot be repaired in a manner that will allow us to continue to hire the dress out, the customer is liable to pay 150% of RRP as stated on website or seek to replace garment within 7 days. The customer is liable to pay any loss of business incurred as a result of the dress not being available for hire the following week, if the dress was booked by the next customer and cannot be supplied due to delay caused by customer. If the dress gets lost, stolen or damaged beyond repair, whether or not such loss, theft, or damage is attributable to any negligence, failure, or omission of the Customer then the Customer is liable to pay 150% of the RRP as stated on the item description on TheOnlyDress' website (or if no RRP stated, the general RRP as stated by the designer) minus any late fees that the Customer has already paid or the customer is liable to replace the item in immaculate/new condition within 7 days. The customer is liable to pay the lost business of the hire fee of the following week, if the dress was booked by the next customer and cannot be supplied due to delay caused by customer. We advise that clients who intend to hire items be extra mindful if using fake tanning products or perfume. In the event that fake tan stains a garment or perfume damages the fabric and rendering it unsuitable for rehire, TheOnlyDress reserves the right to charge the Customer 150% of the recommended retail value as stated on item description on our website. The Customer expressly authorises TheOnlyDress to deduct such fees from the Customer’s credit card, which was provided at the time of placing the Customer’s order.</p>
            <h4>Refunds</h4>
            <p>If you choose not to wear the garment you hired from us at your event, and do not directly notify us as soon as receiving it in the post; we unfortunately cannot provide you with a refund/ store credit. Upon receiving delivery of the dress, if you notify us that you are unable to wear the dress at your event, we will work with you to try and find a solution for you.</p>
            <p>If you wish to cancel your order, please contact our Customer Service. We only issue refunds if your order is cancelled 7 business days prior to the beginning of your rental period. Upon cancellation of your order, we will authorize a refund issued as store credit to be put towards another dress hire at another time. The shipping and cleaning fee will be kept as part of the store credit. If you contact us after we have dispatched the garment, your rental period has started and we will not issue a cancellation of your order. Upon your cancellation request, if you fail to provide us with the requested and required personal documents we reserve the right not to issue you with a refund in the form of a store credit.</p>
